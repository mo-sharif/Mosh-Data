## Getting Started
`npm install rellax --save` or if you're old school like us download and insert `rellax.min.js`

```html
<div class="rellax">
  I’m that default chill speed of "-2"
</div>
<div class="rellax" data-rellax-speed="7">
  I’m super fast!!
</div>
<div class="rellax" data-rellax-speed="-4">
  I’m extra slow and smooth
</div>

<script src="rellax.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // Accepts any class name
  var rellax = new Rellax('.rellax');
</script>
```
```html
<script>
  // Also can pass in optional settings block
  var rellax = new Rellax('.rellax', {
    speed: -2,
    center: false,
    round: true,
    vertical: true,
    horizontal: false
  });
</script>
```
## Features

### Centering
After some fantastic work from [@p-realinho](https://github.com/p-realinho), we just released the ability to center parallax elements in your viewport! We'll be building a nice demo website, but for now check out the tests folder for several examples of how it works.

There's two ways to implement centering, either on specific elements or as a global option.
```html
<div class="rellax" data-rellax-percentage="0.5">
  I’m that default chill speed of "-2" and "centered"
</div>
<div class="rellax" data-rellax-speed="7" data-rellax-percentage="0.5">
  I’m super fast!! And super centered!!
</div>
<div class="rellax" data-rellax-speed="-4" data-rellax-percentage="0.5">
  I’m extra slow and smooth, and hella centered.
</div>
```
```html
<script>
  // Center all the things!
  var rellax = new Rellax('.rellax', {
    center: true
  });
</script>
```
### z-index
If you want to sort your elements properly in the Z space, you can use the data-rellax-zindex property
```html
<div class="rellax">
  I’m that default chill speed of "-2" and default z-index of 0
</div>
<div class="rellax" data-rellax-speed="7" data-rellax-zindex="5">
  I’m super fast!! And on top of the previous element, I'm z-index 5!!
</div>
```

### Horizontal Parallax
Horizontal parallax is disabled by default. You can enable it by passing `horizontal: true` in the settings block.
This feature is intended for panoramic style websites, where users scroll horizontally instead of vertically.
Note that this can work together at the same time with the default vertical parallax. If you do not want this, pass `vertical: false` in the settings block.

### Destroy
```html
<script>
  // Start Rellax
  var rellax = new Rellax('.rellax');
  
  // End Rellax and reset parallax elements to their original positions
  rellax.destroy();
</script>
```
### Callback
```html
<script>
  // Start Rellax
  var rellax = new Rellax('.rellax-blur-card', {
    callback: function(positions) {
      // callback every position change
      console.log(positions);
    }
  });
</script>
```

## Development
In the spirit of lightweight javascript, the build processes (thus far) is lightweight also.

1. Open demo.html
2. Make code changes and refresh browser
3. Once feature is finished or bug fixed, use [jshint](http://jshint.com/) to lint code
4. Fix lint issues then use [Google Closure Compiler](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) to minify
5. 🍻
